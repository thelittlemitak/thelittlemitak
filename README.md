## Welcome to my GitHub account 👋🏼

My name is Jose Riera Tur, and I am a passionate JavaScript developer specializing in creating web applications! On parallel, I am learning:
- NodeJS to create APIs and understand backend functionalities.
- PhaserJS to put into practice OOP and understand video games principles through JS.

While working on (domains bought and projects started, but still not on the server):
- totfosk.com: my artist website containing lists of my favorite music.
- allmyreleases.com: a platform for underground artists to better present their personal releases.

But most importantly: **I am actively looking for a job as a software developer!**

## Something tells me you are a recruiter... 🤓
